## Developer Notes

This is predominantly focused on an algorithm for generating coherent pole move combos. Javascript was only chosen to allow alpha level users to test this on their phones. Almost no time was spent/considered for the user interface at this time. The whole solution is intended to execute in-browser (i.e. there is no server side processing). The solution was authored using current-day in-browser javascript module support (with no build/bundle step either). Any javascript dependencies are directly loaded from CDN (usually [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) so they can be imported like proper modules).
